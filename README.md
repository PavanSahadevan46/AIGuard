AIGuard is a web application that helps healthcare professionals identify patients at risk of adrenal insufficiency and present them with an SEC(Steroid Emergency Card). 
It is not intended to be used in the real world at any point and at the current stage is purely hypothetical in nature. 
It is being developed as a proof of concept for NHS England and as a final year project by Pavan Sahadevan.
