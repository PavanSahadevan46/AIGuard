AIGuard is a web application that helps healthcare professionals identify patients at risk of adrenal insufficiency and present them with an SEC(Steroid Emergency Card).  <br>
It is not intended to be used in the real world at any point and at the current stage is purely hypothetical in nature.  <br>
It is being developed as a proof of concept for NHS Sussex and Surrey and as a final year project by Pavan Sahadevan.  <br>
