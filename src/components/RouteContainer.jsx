/**
 * Route Container component
 *
 * This component is the main route container and it displays a list of routes and additionally navigates them to each routes.
 *
 * It uses route completion context to determine which routes have been completed and disables routes that are not completed,
 * or not completed in order e.g. if the user skips oral and injection and goes straight to inhaled,
 * The oral and injection routes are disabled as there is no point going to those routes if skipped as it could skew results.
 *
 * @author Pavan Sahadevan
 * @version 1.0
 * Developed as a proof of concept for NHS England and as a final year project for CI601 from the University of Brighton.
